## CSCI 310 Group 5 Project
This following project is a group project for USC's CSCI 310 Introduction to Software Engineering class.
The group members of this project are: Bernard Xie, Jenny Yoshihara, Matthew O'Brien, Ivana Wang, Jackson Brodeur, and Sayantan Chakraborty.

The program created intends to be a word cloud generator for song lyrics based on artists that the user can search up. This repository will not only
contain the code for this project, but also will contain all the documents we have created to assist us in our software engineering process.
